# Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer Module 

The Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer module controls the camera, transforming it into an image source for the [DCV (Dynamsoft Capture Vision) architecture](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/web/programming/javascript/) through ISA implementation. It also enhances image quality during acquisition and provides basic viewers for user interaction.
