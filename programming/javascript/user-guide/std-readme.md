# Dynamsoft Capture Vision STD Module 

The Dynamsoft Capture Vision STD module is a collection of classes and functions that facilitate the execution of other modules within the [Dynamsoft Capture Vision architecture](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/web/programming/javascript/). This foundational module plays a crucial role in initializing the WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime environment, which allows for the high-efficiency execution of applications developed utilizing the DCV architecture.
