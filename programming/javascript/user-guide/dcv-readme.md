# Dynamsoft Capture Vision Bundle Module 

The Dynamsoft Capture Vision Bundle is an aggregating SDK of a series of specific functional products including:
 
- Dynamsoft Barcode Reader (DBR): enables users to quickly deploy barcode scanning functionality on all common barcodes such as 1D, QR, PDF417, etc.
- Dynamsoft Label Recognizer (DLR): recognizes meaningful zonal text or symbols within an image, commonly referred to as a "Label" in this context.
- Dynamsoft Document Normalizer (DDN): detects quadrilaterals (or "quads") in images, such as document or table boundaries, and then perform document normalization on the images within those detected quads.
- Dynamsoft Code Parser (DCP): extracts meaningful fields from text/bytes into human-readable information, typically used for post-processing results generated by DBR/DLR.
- Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer (DCE): allows your website to easily control the camera in the browser on desktop or mobile devices.

This module enables all functional products to work together under [Dynamsoft Capture Vision architecture](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/web/programming/javascript/).
